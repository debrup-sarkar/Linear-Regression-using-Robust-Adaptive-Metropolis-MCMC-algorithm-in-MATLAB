# Linear Regression using Metropolis Hastings Algorithm

The Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is a **Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)** method used for sampling from a probability distribution, particularly useful for estimating parameters in Bayesian inference problems. It iteratively proposes new samples based on a proposal distribution, accepting or rejecting them based on an acceptance ratio calculated from the likelihood of the proposed and current samples. 

## The model
A linear model can be expressed as\
$\huge{y = {X}^{T}{\theta} + \epsilon} $  
$\huge{\epsilon \sim N(0, \sigma^{2})}$
